# Assignment 02

Use the code here to count and report the number of unique words in a book of your choice. The code here uses Leo's version of `DynamicArray`. Starter code in `BookReview.java` has been provided, with methods that ensure a graceful way to connect a `Scanner` to a website.

Focus your work on `BookReview.java`. You will need to add a couple of methods to accomplish the required tasks. Method `BookReview.main` should be only calling methods you wrote.

As you develop the work, please try to observe the Programmer's Pack (available in this folder as a PDF file).
